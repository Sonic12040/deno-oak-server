# deno-oak-server

Server template for deno

## Installing Deno

Instructions for installing Deno can be found [here](https://deno.land/#installation)

## Installing Denon (optional)

Denon is the Deno equivalent to nodemon. Denon installation instructions [here](https://deno.land/x/denon@2.4.5). If you have problems with Denon after a Deno upgrade, I recommend a reinstallation of Denon as it fixed the issue for me.

## Common Problems

Trouble using Deno with Bash or zshrc? Add PATH exports to your .bashrc or .zshrc file. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62057786/zsh-command-not-found-denon-even-after-installing-denon/62057787#62057787)

Likewise for Denon, see [here](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/6239#issuecomment-644940111)

## Starting the application

Start the application from the root directory with Deno using `deno run --allow-net http.ts`

Start the application from the root directory with Denon using `denon run --allow-net http.ts`

## Adding methods

Adding functions for handling various aspects of the server such as getting what you need from the database (ORMs for example) belong in the methods folder.

## Adding middleware

Middleware such as loggers, timers, error handlers, setting headers, etc belong in the middleware folder.

## Adding routes

Routes belong in routes.ts in the api folder. An example route has been provided, but more complex examples are available [here](https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.4.0)

## deps.ts and dev_deps.ts

Dependencies for the regular project belong in deps.ts. Dependencies used only during development (such as testing libraries) belong in dev_deps.ts.

## http.test.ts

Example test of the /route data and response returning correctly. If you don't correctly close the server with AbortController, your tests will hang.
